# Interactive Ising Model Simulation

This interactive simulation demonstrates the Ising model, a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. The model shows how individual magnetic spins align to create ordered (ferromagnetic) or disordered (paramagnetic) states depending on temperature.

## Physical Background

The Ising model is a cornerstone of statistical mechanics, describing systems where components have two states, like the magnetic dipole moments of atomic "spins" that can be in one of two states (+1 or âˆ’1). At low temperatures, neighboring spins tend to align, creating long-range order (ferromagnetism). As temperature increases, thermal fluctuations eventually overcome the alignment tendency at a critical temperature, resulting in a phase transition to a disordered (paramagnetic) state.

This simulation allows you to:

- Visualize the real-time evolution of spin states at different temperatures
- Experiment with different lattice structures (square, triangular, hexagonal)
- Calculate magnetization curves and identify critical temperatures
- Study the statistical nature of phase transitions
