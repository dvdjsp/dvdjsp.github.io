# Interactive Ising Model Simulation

This interactive simulation demonstrates the Ising model, a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. The model consists of discrete variables that represent magnetic dipole moments of atomic spins that can be in one of two states (+1 or âˆ’1).

## About the Simulation

The simulator allows you to:
- Visualize the Ising model on different lattice types
- Adjust temperature to observe phase transitions
- Calculate magnetization curves
- Observe critical behavior near the phase transition

## Physical Background

The Ising model is one of the simplest models that shows a phase transition. At low temperatures, the spins align to form a ferromagnetic state, while at high temperatures, thermal fluctuations cause the spins to be randomly oriented in a paramagnetic state.
